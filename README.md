It will be beneficial to have a good understanding of the following technologies (which Genesis is built with):

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev)
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com)
- [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com)
- [Folio](https://github.com/laravel/folio)
- [Volt](https://github.com/livewire/volt)

Learn how to install and configure Geneses below.

## Installation

This preset is intended to be installed into a fresh [Laravel application](https://laravel.com).

> Currently Folio, Volt, and Livewire are still in Beta, so for that reason you'll need to set your *minimum-stability* to *dev*, by finding the following line inside of your `composer.json` file `"minimum-stability": "stable",` and replace with `"minimum-stability": "dev",`

After creating a new Laravel application (and updating the minimum-stability) you can install Genesis with the following commands:

```bash
composer require devdojo/genesis dev-main
php artisan ui genesis
npm install
npm run dev
```

Finally, you'll want to connect a database inside of your application `.env` file and run the following migrations:

```
php artisan migrate
```

Visit your application homepage and you should be good to go ðŸ¤˜

## Authentication

```php
// Usage description here
```

### Testing

Genesis has some basic tests to test out the authentication functionality. You can check those tests by running the following command:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest
```
